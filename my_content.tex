\section{Introduction}

Radiation therapy is now a reliable treatment for oncology.
Despite this consensus, the way to deliver radiotherapy for its best result remain very dependent upon doctors.
Moreover, it appears that there is a large variability across centers.

To achieve the best treatment, doctors need to solve a complex inverse mathematical optimization problem with multiples trade-offs.
There is a lack of standardized prioritization of constraints make the optimization a real challenge.
The standard procedure nowadays is to manually guide computer optimization: dosimetrists manually update the settings of an optimizing software (so called Treatment Planning System).


As this is very new and ongoing research, we generated synthetic phantom patients and associated trust-able clinical dose.
In future work, we hope to be able to apply this technique to real cases.
